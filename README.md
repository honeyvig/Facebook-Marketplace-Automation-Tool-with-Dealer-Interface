# Facebook-Marketplace-Automation-Tool-with-Dealer-Interface
create a scalable and user-friendly solution to automate vehicle listings on Facebook Marketplace for our clients (car dealerships). The tool should allow dealers to log in, access their inventory, and manage their Facebook Marketplace postings easily. Our inventory data is provided via dynamic CSV feeds (e.g., https://boatshackutah.com/fb-export.csv).

Project Scope:

Inventory Management:
- Build a system to fetch, parse, and display inventory from dynamic CSV feeds provided by multiple dealerships.
- Ensure all necessary fields (e.g., Title, Description, Price, Images, Location) are extracted and formatted appropriately for Facebook Marketplace listings.

Facebook Marketplace Automation:
- Automate the creation, updating, and removal of listings on Facebook Marketplace.
- Allow dealers to log in to their Facebook account within the tool for secure posting.
- Handle image uploads and other listing details seamlessly.

Dealer Interface:
-Develop a secure, user-friendly interface where each dealer can:
-Log in to their account.
-Connect their Facebook account for automated posting.
-View their inventory and status of Facebook postings.
-Trigger manual updates or schedule automatic syncs.

Key Features:
-Ability to handle multiple dealerships with individual Facebook integrations.
-Scheduling options for regular updates (e.g., daily, weekly).
-Error handling and logging to monitor failed uploads or updates.
-Secure storage and management of dealer-specific credentials (if needed).

The solution must be easy to use for non-technical users, ensuring dealerships can handle their postings independently after setup.

Several companies offer solutions to automate the posting of car dealership inventories to Facebook Marketplace. Here are some examples:

Glo3D's Facebook Marketplace Auto-Poster: Glo3D provides a tool that automates the posting and response process on Facebook Marketplace, combining software automation with human support to efficiently manage listings and leads.

Car Lister Pro: This service offers a Chrome extension that allows dealerships to import vehicle inventory from their Dealer Management System (DMS) and list vehicle data and photos to Facebook Marketplace with one click.

AutoManager's Facebook Marketplace Auto-Posting Utility: AutoManager has developed a utility that enables batch listing of vehicles on Facebook Marketplace, integrating with their WebManager platform and supporting Windows operating systems.

DealerCenter's Facebook Marketplace Auto-Uploader Utility: DealerCenter offers a tool that mimics manual posting from a personal page, allowing for automated vehicle postings. This utility is compatible with Windows PCs and requires Google Chrome for installation.

Dealer Car Search's Facebook Marketplace Posting Tool: Dealer Car Search provides an automatic posting tool to keep dealership leads flowing by listing vehicles on Facebook Marketplace.
----------

Backend Structure (Python Example using Flask)
1. Install Required Libraries

You can use Python for the backend. Install the necessary libraries:

pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-OAuthlib pandas selenium

2. Flask Backend API (app.py)

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, redirect, url_for
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_oauthlib.client import OAuth
import csv
import pandas as pd
import json
import requests
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///dealership.db'
app.secret_key = 'randomsecretkey'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
oauth = OAuth(app)

# Define a Dealership Model to store Facebook credentials and inventory data
class Dealership(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
    facebook_token = db.Column(db.String(500), nullable=True)
    inventory = db.relationship('Vehicle', backref='dealership', lazy=True)

class Vehicle(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(200), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.String(1000), nullable=True)
    price = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
    images = db.Column(db.String(500), nullable=True)  # JSON array of image URLs
    location = db.Column(db.String(200), nullable=True)
    dealership_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('dealership.id'), nullable=False)

# Route to upload and parse CSV data
@app.route('/upload_inventory', methods=['POST'])
def upload_inventory():
    csv_file = request.files['file']
    dealership_id = request.form['dealership_id']
    # Parse the CSV
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
    
    # Store vehicles in the database
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        vehicle = Vehicle(
            title=row['Title'],
            description=row['Description'],
            price=row['Price'],
            images=json.dumps([row['Image1'], row['Image2'], row['Image3']]),  # assuming there are 3 image columns
            location=row['Location'],
            dealership_id=dealership_id
        )
        db.session.add(vehicle)
    db.session.commit()

    return jsonify({'message': 'Inventory uploaded successfully'})

# Route to list inventory
@app.route('/inventory', methods=['GET'])
def get_inventory():
    dealership_id = request.args.get('dealership_id')
    vehicles = Vehicle.query.filter_by(dealership_id=dealership_id).all()
    inventory = []
    for vehicle in vehicles:
        inventory.append({
            'title': vehicle.title,
            'description': vehicle.description,
            'price': vehicle.price,
            'images': json.loads(vehicle.images),
            'location': vehicle.location
        })
    return jsonify({'inventory': inventory})

# OAuth route to integrate Facebook
@app.route('/login/facebook')
def login_facebook():
    facebook = oauth.remote_app(
        'facebook',
        consumer_key='YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID',
        consumer_secret='YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET',
        request_token_params={
            'scope': 'email',
        },
        base_url='https://graph.facebook.com/',
        request_token_url=None,
        access_token_method='POST',
        access_token_url='/oauth/access_token',
        authorize_url='https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth'
    )
    
    return facebook.authorize(callback=url_for('authorized', _external=True))

# Route to handle the callback and store Facebook credentials
@app.route('/login/facebook/authorized')
def authorized():
    facebook = oauth.remote_app('facebook')
    response = facebook.authorized_response()
    if response is None or response.get('access_token') is None:
        return 'Access denied: reason={} error={}'.format(request.args['error_reason'], request.args['error_description'])
    
    dealer = Dealership.query.get(request.args['dealership_id'])
    dealer.facebook_token = response['access_token']
    db.session.commit()
    
    return jsonify({'message': 'Facebook account connected successfully'})

# Helper function to post to Facebook Marketplace
def post_to_facebook(dealership, vehicle):
    # Use Selenium or Puppeteer to automate Facebook posting
    # Access the Facebook Marketplace form, populate the fields, and submit the form.
    pass

# Schedule updates, e.g., daily using Celery
@app.route('/schedule_updates', methods=['POST'])
def schedule_updates():
    dealership_id = request.form['dealership_id']
    frequency = request.form['frequency']  # daily, weekly, etc.
    
    # Schedule updates based on frequency
    # Use Celery or another scheduler to trigger post_to_facebook at set intervals
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Frontend Dashboard (React Example)

The frontend will allow users to:

    Log in using their credentials.
    Upload their inventory CSV.
    Connect their Facebook account.
    View inventory and update listings.

You can use React to build a clean, interactive UI for these features.
React Component (LoginPage.js)

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function LoginPage() {
  const [dealerId, setDealerId] = useState('');
  const [file, setFile] = useState(null);

  const handleLogin = () => {
    axios.post('/login/facebook', { dealerId })
      .then(response => {
        alert('Logged in with Facebook');
      })
      .catch(error => {
        alert('Error logging in');
      });
  };

  const handleFileUpload = (event) => {
    const data = new FormData();
    data.append('file', file);
    data.append('dealership_id', dealerId);
    
    axios.post('/upload_inventory', data)
      .then(response => {
        alert('Inventory uploaded');
      })
      .catch(error => {
        alert('Error uploading inventory');
      });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Dealership ID" onChange={(e) => setDealerId(e.target.value)} />
      <input type="file" onChange={(e) => setFile(e.target.files[0])} />
      <button onClick={handleFileUpload}>Upload Inventory</button>
      <button onClick={handleLogin}>Connect Facebook</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default LoginPage;

Automated Facebook Posting (Using Puppeteer or Selenium)

For the actual automation of the Facebook Marketplace listings, we can use Puppeteer or Selenium to fill in the details and submit the form. Here's a simplified example using Puppeteer in Node.js:
Automating Facebook Marketplace Post with Puppeteer (example.js)

const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

async function postToFacebookMarketplace(vehicle) {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to Facebook login page
  await page.goto('https://www.facebook.com/login');

  // Log in to Facebook
  await page.type('#email', 'YOUR_FACEBOOK_EMAIL');
  await page.type('#pass', 'YOUR_FACEBOOK_PASSWORD');
  await page.click('button[name="login"]');
  await page.waitForNavigation();

  // Navigate to the Marketplace page
  await page.goto('https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/create');

  // Fill in vehicle details
  await page.type('#title', vehicle.title);
  await page.type('#description', vehicle.description);
  await page.type('#price', vehicle.price.toString());
  // Add images (Note: you'd need to upload images via the Facebook interface)
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  await browser.close();
}

postToFacebookMarketplace({
  title: '2021 Toyota Corolla',
  description: 'Great condition, low mileage',
  price: 20000
});

Error Handling, Logging, and Scheduling

    Error Handling: Implement logging (e.g., using Pythonâ€™s logging module or a logging library in Node.js) to keep track of failures during the upload process.
    Scheduling: Use Celery (Python) or Node-cron (Node.js) to schedule periodic updates (e.g., daily or weekly) to keep inventory listings updated automatically.

Next Steps:

    Set up OAuth integration for secure Facebook login.
    Use Puppeteer or Selenium for automating the Facebook listing process.
    Build out the frontend in React for the dashboard.
    Implement error handling and logging to monitor failed uploads.

This solution should allow car dealerships to manage their listings efficiently on Facebook Marketplace, leveraging automation to save time and improve their workflow.
